# Enspiral Services People Agreement

This document outlines the relationship individuals have with Enspiral Services.

There are three categories: Members, Contributors and External Contractors

## Members

### What is Membership?
Members are the legal owners of Enspiral Services. They are responsible for appointing the core team, the directors and are the ultimate holders of power in the collective. 

They hold one non-transferrable governance share per person.

Enspiral Services Members are distinct from Enspiral Foundation Members and managed through independent processes.

### Becoming a Member
Any existing Member can nominate a Contributor for Membership which is approved by a consensus decision of the existing Members.

There is no formal Criteria for someone to become a Member. It really just comes down to the judgement of the other Members. Some of the questions people consider are: 

* Have we worked with them long enough to really know them?
* Are they committed to Enspiral Services?
* Do they reliably produce good quality work?
* Are they aligned with the [Enspiral Values](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/blob/services-ownership/agreements/vision.md#where-we-are-starting-from---our-core-values)?

### Responsibilities
Members' primary responsibilities are to: 

* nurture and protect the culture, values and mission of the company.
* actively work to grow and/or improve Enspiral Services.
* attend and participate in Members' meetings and decisions.
* use Enspiral Services as their primary vehicle for contract work.

### Benefits of Membership
There are no distinct benefits to membership and it is primarily a role of service and stewardship.

### Liability of Members
As Shareholders members have no more or less liability than Contributors. 

### Maintaining Membership
Similar to the Enspiral Foundation every six months we ask Members if they want to continue their Membership. 

* **agree**: continue being a Member.
* **abstain**: take a 6 month sabbatical and keep their governance share but opt out of the members loomio group.
* **disagree**: dissolve their governance share and step back to Contributor.

### Ceasing to be a Member
As well as voluntarily stepping back, a 75% vote of existing Members can forcibly dissolve somebody's governance share. This has never happened and is a safety net to resolve unreconcilable conflict amongst Members.

## Contributors

A contributor is someone who works for Enspiral Services as a core participant in the collective.

All Members are also Contributors

### Becoming a Contributor
Any Enspiral Services' Team can invite someone to become a Contributor. No approval is required and the Team is responsible for their onboarding and support.

### Contracts
A Contributor can have either an Employee Contract or a Contractors Agreement with the company at their discretion. The fundamental relationship is the same regardless of the contract, though they have different legal and financial requirements.

### Responsibilities

* **Meet their commitments**: the most important responsibility is that a Contributor does what they say they will and acts reliably.
* **Manage their finances**: Contributors are responsible for their own livelihoods and ensuring they have enough money to meet any financial commitments they make to themselves (such as salary, holiday pay, sick pay and redundancy payments). 
* **Participate in the collective**: actively engage in  decision making, budgeting and information sharing with the wider collective.

These responsibilities, particularly the financial management, are very different to a normal employment or contracting relationship. Contributors receive a much larger percentage of revenue than at a traditional agency or services company and that comes with additional responsibility.

### Benefits

* **Enspiral Account**: Each Contributor has a discretionary budget account which receives their portion of any revenue they earn and they control it absolutely. They can spend this money on anything they like, so long as it's legal.
* **Variable Contributions**: By default 20% of all revenue earned is contributed to collective accounts but a Contributor can vary this amount at their discretion (even to 0%). They do not need to ask permission, they just need to notify the group that they are doing so.
* **Budgeting rights**: Contributors retain budgeting rights on funds they contribute to core accounts that are in surplus of our fixed costs and can decide where they get spent.
* **Freedom and Autonomy**: Contributors are free to work as much or as little as they like, from where they choose and when works best for them. They are not required to do any work they do not want to.
* **Access to shared leads**: We have a shared marketplace where we actively share leads and opportunities with each other and help people find work.

### Ceasing to be a Contributor
If a Contributor hasn't had any activity on their Enspiral Account for 6 months then the core team can (at their discretion) invoke the redundancy / inactivity clauses in their contract.

Our employee contracts and contractor agreements also have standard termination clauses which can be exercised in various circumstances.

##External Contractor
An External Contractor is someone who does work for Enspiral Services on an ad-hoc basis at the direction of a Contributor. 

Any Contributor is free to engage an individual as an External Contractor and is responsible for meeting the terms of the contract they enter into. 

An External Contractor does not have access to Loomio, Cobudget, my.enspiral or any other Enspiral systems and does not need to be an Enspiral Foundation Contributor.
